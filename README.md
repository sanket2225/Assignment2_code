Complete Explanation of the Data Structure and Algorithm

1. Importing Packages and Class Declaration
java
import java.util.*;

public class TravelRouteFinder {
Import Statements:
Imports necessary Java utility packages (java.util) for using data structures like Map, List, Set, etc.
Class Declaration:
Defines a public class named TravelRouteFinder, encapsulating the functionality to find and display the travel route.

2. Nested City Class
java
    static class City {
        String name;
        List<String> neighbors;

        public City(String name) {
            this.name = name;
            this.neighbors = new ArrayList<>();
        }
    }
Nested City Class:
Defines a static nested class City to represent a city and its neighbors.
Fields:
name: Represents the name of the city.
neighbors: Represents a list of neighboring cities.
Constructor:
Initializes a city object with its name and an empty list of neighbors.

3. Static Variables
java
    static Map<String, City> graph;
    static List<String> route;
    static Set<String> visited;
Static Variables:
graph: A static Map that maps city names (String) to City objects. It represents the graph where cities are nodes and neighboring cities are edges.
route: A static List of String that stores the sequence of cities visited in the route.
visited: A static Set of String that keeps track of visited cities during the DFS traversal to avoid revisiting cities.

4. Method: findTravelRoute
java
    public static List<String> findTravelRoute(List<String[]> tickets) {
        // Step 1: Build the graph
        graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (String[] ticket : tickets) {
            String fromCity = ticket[0];
            String toCity = ticket[1];
            graph.putIfAbsent(fromCity, new City(fromCity));
            graph.putIfAbsent(toCity, new City(toCity));
            graph.get(fromCity).neighbors.add(toCity);
        }

        // Step 2: Initialize variables
        route = new ArrayList<>();
        visited = new HashSet<>();

        // Step 3: Find the route using DFS starting from Kiev
        String startCity = "Kiev";
        dfs(startCity);

        return route;
    }
findTravelRoute Method:
Step 1: Build the Graph:
Initializes an empty HashMap (graph) to store city names mapped to their respective City objects.
Iterates through each ticket (String[] array) in the tickets list:
Retrieves the fromCity and toCity from the ticket.
Adds entries to the graph mapping each city to its neighbors by initializing City objects if they don't exist and adding neighbors to the neighbors list.
Step 2: Initialize Variables:
Initializes route as a new empty ArrayList to store the route of cities.
Initializes visited as a new empty HashSet to keep track of visited cities during the DFS traversal.
Step 3: Find the Route using DFS:
Sets the starting city (startCity) to "Kiev" (as specified).
Calls the dfs method with startCity to begin the Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal and construct the route.

5. Depth-First Search (DFS) Method: dfs
java
    private static boolean dfs(String city) {
        visited.add(city);
        route.add(city);

        // Check if all cities have been visited exactly once
        if (route.size() == graph.size() + 1) {
            return true;
        }

        // Explore neighbors
        for (String neighbor : graph.getOrDefault(city, new City(city).neighbors)) {
            if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                if (dfs(neighbor)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        // Backtrack
        visited.remove(city);
        route.remove(route.size() - 1);
        return false;
    }
dfs Method:
Purpose: Performs Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal starting from the current city.
Parameters: city is the current city being visited.
Steps:
Marks city as visited by adding it to the visited set and appending it to the route list.
Checks if all cities have been visited exactly once (route.size() == graph.size() + 1). If true, returns true indicating route construction is complete.
Iterates through each neighboring city (neighbor) of the current city:
If neighbor has not been visited (!visited.contains(neighbor)), recursively calls dfs(neighbor).
If a valid route is found (dfs(neighbor) returns true), propagates true back up the call stack indicating the route is complete.
Backtracking: If all neighbors have been explored and no valid route is found, removes city from visited and route (backtracks) and returns false.

6. Main Method
java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String[]> tickets = new ArrayList<>();
        tickets.add(new String[]{"Paris", "Skopje"});
        tickets.add(new String[]{"Zurich", "Amsterdam"});
        tickets.add(new String[]{"Prague", "Zurich"});
        tickets.add(new String[]{"Barcelona", "Berlin"});
        tickets.add(new String[]{"Kiev", "Prague"});
        tickets.add(new String[]{"Skopje", "Paris"});
        tickets.add(new String[]{"Amsterdam", "Barcelona"});
        tickets.add(new String[]{"Berlin", "Kiev"});
        tickets.add(new String[]{"Berlin", "Amsterdam"});

        List<String> route = findTravelRoute(tickets);

        if (route != null) {
            System.out.println("The route your son traveled is:");
            for (String city : route) {
                System.out.print(city + " -> ");
            }
            System.out.println("End");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No valid route found.");
        }
    }
}

Main Method:
Initializes a list of tickets representing the travel tickets from one city to another.
Calls findTravelRoute with tickets to compute and retrieve the travel route.
Prints the route step-by-step followed by "End" to indicate the end of the route.
If no valid route is found (route == null), prints "No valid route found."

Summary:

This Java program effectively finds and displays the route your son traveled using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm on a graph representation of cities and their connections via train tickets. It ensures each city is visited exactly once and constructs the route accordingly. The findTravelRoute method initializes the graph, starts DFS from Kiev, and constructs the route based on the provided tickets, ensuring clarity and correctness in displaying the travel route.
